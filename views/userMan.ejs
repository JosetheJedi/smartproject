            </h1>
            <p>
                Our embedded system is a resilient smart garden capable of self watering and assisted remote
                monitoring. Here in California
                we’re in the midst of a drought; which becomes a problem when we have so much farming. Every drop of
                water
                is precious and the farming process could use some help with optimizing its water use. Too much
                watering
                is just wasting this limited resource and underwatering kills plants or renders them unable to produce
                maximum
                crop production.
            </p>
            <p>Our Resilient Smart Garden will help to ensure vegetable plants are not over or under watered. It will
                find the
                water balance to grow the perfect vegetable. It also takes the mandatory watering out of the users
                hands
                and automates watering based on the moisture of the soil.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Smart Garden will take moisture and temperature readings to decide if the garden needs more water.
                These readings will
                be stored in a database that is accessible online and can be accessed through pc or mobile smartphone.
                The
                data can be used to further research on the best watering method that fits for different kinds of
                plants.

                Hardware
            </h1>
            <p>
                The Arduino Board functions as the brain of the whole system. Using the WiFi Shield the Arduino Board
                can communicate with
                the online server to record a user’s garden as well as to control the other components connected to the
                Arduino.
            </p>
            <p>
                A few of the important components the Arduino Board is connected to are:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Humidity and temperature sensor
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Soil moisture sensor
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Water solenoid valve
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Both the temperature sensor and soil moisture sensor, allows users to record the reading, so that they
                may be displayed later.
                The water solenoid valve functions properly when connected to an outdoor water faucet and a 12v power
                supply.

                    To install the WiFi shield you must first solder on headers so that it stacks on top of the Arduino

                    In the schedules pane, you will be able to create a new watering schedule that you would like to
                    test out on the plant. You will
                    have the option of watering the plant twice a day and you can set the duration of the watering.

                    <br>
                    You will also be able to select which watering schedule should be the default. This is to help you
                    save schedules that worked for you in
                    the past, when you want to test out a new watering technique. You can also use this feature to have
                    preset watering schedules for fall, winter, spring
                    and summer.

                    To create a new watering schedule click on <button class="btn btn-info btn-sm">Create Schedule</button>
                    and give your new schedule a name.

                <p>
                    When the new modal pops up, you will be able to set the start time of the watering and the duration. If you would like 
                    to repeat the watering again that same day then select the checkbox.

                    The second start time dialog will be displayed so you can set the second watering time. Once you are done, click create and your watering schedules 
                    will be displayed in the Schedules & Logs page along with any logs that the Arduino board sends to the server.
