                    <p>The resilient smart garden will help us out here in California where weâ€™re in the midst of a
                        drought;
                        which becomes a problem when we have so much farming. Every drop of water is precious and the
                        farming
                        process could use some help with optimizing its water use. Too much watering is just wasting
                        this
                        limited resource and underwatering kills plants or renders them unable to produce maximum crop
                        production.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our Resilient Smart Garden will help to ensure vegetable plants are not over or under watered.
                        It will
                        find the water balance to grow the perfect vegetable. It also takes the mandatory watering out
                        of
                        the users hands and automates watering based on the moisture of the soil.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Smart Garden will take moisture and temperature readings to decide if the garden needs more
                        water.
                        These readings will be stored in a database that is accessible online and can be accessed
                        through
                        pc or mobile smartphone. The data can be used to further research on the best watering method
                        that
                        fits for different kinds of plants.

                    What are the features:
                </h1>
                <h2>App Features</h2>
                <p>
                    The mobile and web app will come with 3 key features: checking garden logs, creating garden
                    watering schedules,
                    and sharing garden data with other people. When choosing to look up garden logs you can search by
                    date, then
                    select the specific log from the list of logs recorded for that day, and have the log displayed on
                    your screen.
                    Creating a garden watering schedule is an ease by simply typing in a name for it and choosing the
                    desired time to
                    water, duration time, and the option whether to have the schedule repeated daily. A user can also
                    choose to share
                    any of their recorded logs, watering schedules, or their plant's progress. When choosing to share
                    their data
                    through the mobile app a user is allowed to share their data through different means of
                    communication like SMS,
                    email, or social media.
                </p>
                <h2>Arduino Features</h2>
                <p>
                    The Arduino Uno Rev3 Board was chosen for this project because it is one of the most used and
                    popular boards
                    available for projects of various complexities. It also doesn't require much power and can be
                    powered through
                    usb, AC-to-DC power adapter, or a battery adapter. Another main features of the board is that it
                    has 14 digital
                    input/output pins and 6 analog pins meaning that it can be equiped with various other components
                    like a WiFi shield,
                    different sensors, or even other boards. Some of the features that we use from the Adruino Board
                    for this project
                    are the ability to easily stack other boards on top, for example a WiFi Shield for connecting the
                    Arduino to a
                    WiFi network. Another feature that we are taking advantage of is the number of input/output pins,
                    which we are using
                    to connect multiple sensors at the same time. Lastly, the Arduino Board has the ability to also
                    provide enough power
                    to power different components for this project we didn't need any additional power source besides
                    the one that is
                    powering the board itself.
                </p>
                <h1 id="project_components">
                    What are the components:
                </h1>
                <h2>Hardware Required</h2>
                <p>
                    The Arduino Board is one of the primary hardware required for this project because it is what
                    connects the
                    various other components together and functions kind of like the human brain. It is capable of
                    communicating
                    with the components connected and allows the user reprogram the board with ease. There is also
                    other published
                    project tutorials that are well documented and can be referenced to replicate the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The WiFi Shield is another primary hardware required because it is what actually allows the Arduino
                    Board
                    to connect to an online connection through WiFi. The shield also has the capability to be stacked
                    on top
                    of the board, so that it is powered directly through the board without any additional cables and
                    still
                    provide access to the board's input/output pins. We will be using the shield to publish our data
                    onto an
                    online database and allow the user to control the Arduino Board online. We chose the SparkFun WiFi
                    Shield
                    because the manufacturer provides great documentation and examples online. However, you will need
                    to solder
                    on the stackable headers yourself and a 2.4 GHz Antenna with a U.FL connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other primary hardware required are the soil moisture sensor and the temperature and humidity
                    sensor.
                    These sensors provide data feed that will be used to monitor the environmental conditions of the
                    user's
                    garden. The sensors are both connected directly to a breadboard and the breadboard connected to the
                    Arduino Board through jumper cables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last hardware required is the water solenoid valve. The valve will be used to control the flow
                    of
                    water. The valve also required a power source of 12v, unfortunately the Arduino Board can only
                    provide
                    up to 5v. Therefore, we will need to use a TIP120 transistor, a 1k Ohm resistor, and a diode to
                    provide
                    enough power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An optional hardware piece is the LCD module. We chose to use one because it allows us to display
                    data
                    directly to the LCD screen module for debugging purposes.
                </p>
                <h2>Software Required</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>NPM</b> - NPM is the package manager that we are using for NodeJS. The NPM also has a package
                    registry that
                    allows users to download any package that might be useful for their projects. Our group plans to
                    use NPM
                    for downloading some of the packages available on the registry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>MongoDB</b> - MongoDB is a JSON-like document-oriented database. It also utilizes Ad hoc
                    queries, which allows
                    for our group to save system resources because each query isn't predetermined. Our group chose
                    MongoDB
                    because of the advantages of it being a NoSQL database and the open-source code available online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Arduino IDE</b> - The Arduino IDE is what the makers of the Arduino Board recommend to use as
                    well as most
                    of the Arduino Community. The Arduino IDE also comes with tools like the Serial Monitor which
                    allows
                    direct communication with the board and it's components on a pc. Another benefit of using this IDE
                    is
                    the ease of finding libraries and using preinstalled examples that can be uploaded onto the board.
                </p>
                <h2>Languages Being Used</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>C++</b> - This is the default language that the libraries for the Arduino Board are written in.
                    Our group
                    also has experience coding in C++, which is why we chose to code in C++ for the Arduino Board.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Objective-C</b> - The purpose of this language is that it is object-oriented and is what is used
                    for
                    most Apple APIs. We will be developing the app for Apple devices, therefore it makes sense that we
                    use objective-c for coding the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>NodeJS</b> - We chose to use NodeJS over PHP or ASP because of the key benefits like: running
                    single
                    threads, non-blocking, and asynchronously programming. This allows NodeJS to be more efficient
                    because it elimnates having to wait completion of a request before moving on to the next request.
                    This langauge is what allows our site to create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on
                    the server. In addition, it can can add, delete, and modify data in our database
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>HTML</b> - This is just a standard markup language that is commonly used to create web pages.
                    Therefore,
                    as it is a standard we chose to use HTML to create our website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>CSS</b> - This language allows us to specify certain elements found on our site like the font,
                    size,
                    columns, and etc. It is basically what controls the appearance of our website.

                    <h3>Authentication</h3>
                    <p>
                        To be able to use the API, you must make a call to this API end point:
                        https://resilientsmartgarden.com/api/authetication.
                        <br>
                        A users email and password must be provided in the body of the JSON object:
                        <pre>{<br>   "email": "test@gmail.com",<br>   "password": "test1234"<br>}</pre>
                        <br>
                        And you will get the following response if an existing username and password has been given.
                        <pre>{<br>  "success": true,<br>  "message": "Enjoy your Garden!",<br>  "token": "some_token"<br>}</pre>
                        After getting the token everything else is pretty easy and straight forward. The token is refered to as <code>x-access-token</code> when making <b>GET</b> requests and <code>token</code> when making <b>POST</b> requests.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To retrieve a users gardens through the API you just supply the <code>x-access-token</code> and the users <code>email</code> through headers of the <b>GET</b> request.
                        <pre>"headers":<br>{<br>   "x-access-token":<br>   "some_token",<br>   "email": "final@gmail.com"<br>}</pre>
                        You will get the gardens in JSON format as a response.

                    <p>
                        When creating a garden all you have to supply is the <code>garden</code> name and the <code>token</code> through the body of the <b>POST</b> request.
                        <pre>{<br>  "token": "some_token",<br>  "garden": "API Garden"<br>}</pre>
                        It will then return a success message in JSON format.

                    <p>
                        Getting the plants in a garden is the same as getting the garden but you supply the <code>gardenid</code> of the garden 
                        that you want to get the list of plants from followed by the <code>x-access-token</code> through the headers of the <b>GET</b> request.
                        <pre>"headers":<br>{<br>    "x-access-token": "some_token",<br>    "gardenid": "id#"<br>}</pre>
                        This will give you the list of plants in that given garden in JSON format.

                    <p>
                        When creating a plant, you will need to supply the <code>gardenid</code> of the garden that you want to create the plant in, and the <code>token</code> for the user, along with 
                        the <code>plantName</code> through the body of the <b>POST</b> request.

                    <p>
                        When getting logs of the plant you supply the <code>gardenid</code> and <code>plantid</code> to get the logs along with the <code>x-access-token</code> through the headers of the <b>GET</b> request.
                        <pre>"headers":<br>{<br>    "x-access-token": "some_token",<br>    "gardenid": "id#",<br>    "plantid": "id#"<br>}</pre>

                        So here is the big one! When you want to create a log for a plant the Arduino would send this following information back to the server. <code>gardenid</code>, <code>plantid</code>, 
                        <code>token</code>, <code>waterUsed</code> as a string, <code>moisture</code> as a integer or float, <code>humidity</code> as an integer or float, <code>temperature</code> as an integer or float, <code>date</code>, <code>time</code> 
                        in UNIX milliseconds, and <code>offset</code> which is the UTC offset through the body of the <b>POST</b> request.
                        <pre>{<br>  "gardenid": "id#",<br>  "plantid": "id#",<br>  "token": "some_token",<br>  "waterUsed": "1 gal",<br>  "moisture": 40,<br>  "humidity": 60,<br>  "temperature": 78,<br>  "dateCreated": {<br>      "date": "2018-12-15",<br>      "time": "1539725369736",<br>      "offset": 7<br>  }<br>}</pre>
